TheDSAGame - Docstring / Game Overview

This module implements a small terminal-based puzzle / stealth game that
combines graph algorithms, pathfinding, and resource management. The playfield
is a rectangular grid of nodes (cells) connected by undirected edges with
integer weights. The player must navigate from a start cell to an exit cell
while managing limited energy, toggling edges (links) to form a connected
network, and avoiding moving guards. Some edges are marked as "critical" and
belong to a minimum spanning tree (MST) computed at startup; activating these
is necessary to ensure the network between the player and the exit can be
connected.

Key concepts and components
- Grid graph:
    - Nodes correspond to grid cells (rows x cols).
    - Edges exist between orthogonally adjacent cells and have a random weight.
    - Edges can be active or inactive; active edges are traversable by the
        player and influence guard movement costs.

- DSU (Disjoint Set Union / Union-Find):
    - Used to compute connectivity when determining the MST (Kruskal's
        algorithm) and to check active connectivity between the player's node and
        the exit node.

- Kruskal's algorithm:
    - Computes an MST on the full grid graph by sorting edges by weight and
        unioning components using the DSU structure. Edges in the MST are marked
        as "critical".

- Edge states:
    - active: whether the edge is currently open/traversable.
    - critical: whether the edge belongs to the MST (important edges the player
        should prioritize activating).

- Player and exit:
    - The player starts at cell 0 (top-left).
    - The exit is at the last cell (bottom-right).
    - Player movement is restricted to neighboring cells and only allowed across
        active edges.

- Guards (enemies):
    - A small set of guard agents are placed randomly on the grid.
    - Each turn, guards compute shortest-path distances from their current
        position using Dijkstra's algorithm over the graph where active edges
        have lower traversal cost and inactive edges have a higher traversal cost.
    - Guards greedily move to neighboring cells that reduce their computed
        distance to the player's current cell. Guards capture the player if they
        occupy the same cell.

- Pathfinding (Dijkstra):
    - Used by guards to compute distances respecting active/inactive edge
        traversal costs. Active edges are cheap; inactive edges are expensive,
        so guards prefer to use active links.

Gameplay and mechanics
- Turn-based loop:
    - Each loop iteration represents one turn. The player issues a command,
        then guards move, and energy is decremented.

- Commands:
    - Movement: w/a/s/d or up/left/down/right to attempt to move into an
        adjacent cell. Movement only succeeds if the corresponding edge is active.
    - Toggle edge: 't' to toggle an adjacent edge's active state. The player
        is prompted for a direction (u/d/l/r or WASD variants). Toggling an edge
        costs energy.
    - Quit: 'q' to exit the game.

- Energy:
    - The player starts with a finite amount of energy (a resource).
    - Certain actions consume energy (toggling edges costs energy; each turn
        also reduces energy). Running out of energy results in failure.

- Victory and defeat:
    - Victory: reach the exit cell while the player's connected component (over
        active edges) contains the exit â€” i.e., the network is connected from the
        player to the exit.
    - Defeat: be captured by a guard (occupying the same cell) or run out of
        energy.
    - The game also displays the count of "critical" MST edges that remain
        inactive to encourage the player to prioritize their activation.

Rendering and UI
- Terminal-based rendering prints a 2D textual view of the grid where:
    - '.' is an empty cell or inactive edge,
    - '-' or '|' indicates active horizontal/vertical edges,
    - special characters indicate critical inactive edges differently,
    - 'P' represents the player, 'X' the exit, 'G' guards, and '!' a clash
        marker when a guard shares the player's cell.
- A legend and status line show current turn, remaining energy, and how to
    control the game.

Implementation notes and algorithms
- The grid graph is represented by an edge dictionary keyed by frozenset({a,b})
    where a and b are node indices. This makes edges undirected and easy to
    lookup and toggle.
- MST computation uses Kruskal's algorithm with an in-house DSU class.
- Guards use Dijkstra's algorithm on a weighted graph where the cost to cross
    an edge depends only on whether it is active (low cost) or inactive (high
    cost).
- Active connectivity between two nodes is computed by running a DSU over
    currently active edges and comparing roots.

Potential improvements
- More informative rendering (show edge weights, clearer critical edge
    symbols).
- Better guard AI (e.g., multi-step planning or coordination).
- Save/load game state, difficulty levels, procedurally generated objectives,
    or multiple levels.
- Refactor rendering code to remove repeated calculations and simplify grid
    coordinate mapping.
- Replace blocking input with a non-blocking or GUI interface for better UX.
