Q1. Explain the OSI model and TCP/IP model — layer by layer.
A: OSI Model (7 layers):
   -Physical: Transmits raw bits over physical medium.
   -Data Link: Frames, MAC addressing, error detection.
   -Network: Routing, logical addressing (IP).
   -Transport: End-to-end delivery, TCP/UDP.
   -Session: Manages sessions between applications.
   -Presentation: Data translation, encryption, compression.
   -Application: Interfaces with end-user applications.

   TCP/IP Model (4 layers):
   -Network Interface: Physical and data link functions.
   -Internet: IP addressing and routing.
   -Transport: TCP/UDP for end-to-end communication.
   -Application: HTTP, FTP, DNS, etc.

Q2. What is the difference between TCP and UDP?
A: TCP: Connection-oriented, reliable, ensures delivery, slower.
   UDP: Connectionless, no delivery guarantee, faster, used in streaming and gaming.

Q3. Explain how a DNS query works.
A: Browser queries a DNS server to translate domain name to IP. 
   Steps:
   -Browser checks cache.
   -If not found, query goes to recursive DNS.
   -Recursive DNS queries root, TLD, and authoritative servers.
   -IP address is returned to the browser.

Q4. What happens when you type a URL in the browser and press Enter?
A: Steps:
   -Browser parses URL.
   -DNS resolves domain to IP.
   -TCP connection established (3-way handshake).
   -HTTP request sent.
   -Server responds with HTML, CSS, JS.
   -Browser renders the page.

Q5. What is an IP address? Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6.
A: IP address uniquely identifies a device on a network.
   IPv4: 32-bit, dotted decimal, ~4 billion addresses.
   IPv6: 128-bit, hexadecimal, huge address space, auto-configuration supported.

Q6. Explain ARP, RARP, and DHCP.
A: ARP: Maps IP to MAC address.
   RARP: Maps MAC to IP (used for diskless devices).
   DHCP: Dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.

Q7. What is congestion control in TCP? Explain its phases.
A: Congestion control prevents network overload. 
   Phases:
   -Slow Start: Begin with small window size, increase exponentially.
   -Congestion Avoidance: Linear increase to avoid overload.
   -Fast Retransmit: Retransmit packet on detecting loss.
   -Fast Recovery: Reduce window size, continue transmission.

Q8. What is a subnet and how is subnetting done?
A: Subnet: Divides a larger network into smaller networks for efficiency.
   Subnetting: Split IP address using subnet mask to separate network and host portions.

Q9. Explain routing algorithms and types of routing.
A: Routing Algorithms: Determine path from source to destination.
   Distance Vector: Uses hop count; examples: RIP.
   Link State: Uses network topology; examples: OSPF.
   Types: Static (manual), Dynamic (automatic).

Q10. Difference between switch, hub, and router.
A: Hub: Broadcasts data to all ports, layer 1.
   Switch: Sends data to specific MAC addresses, layer 2.
   Router: Routes packets between networks using IP, layer 3.

Q11. What is VLAN and Why it is used ?
A: A VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a logical subgroup within a physical network that isolates
   traffic for better security and performance.
   a. Allows multiple virtual networks to exist on a single physical switch.
   b.VLANs reduce broadcast traffic and improve network management.

Q12. What is NAT and how does it work?
A: NAT (Network Address Translation) converts private IP addresses
  into a public IP address for communication with the internet.

  Types of NAT:
  Static NAT: One-to-one mapping.
  Dynamic NAT: One-to-many mapping from a pool.
  PAT (Port Address Translation): Many private IPs share a single public IP by using different
   port numbers.

Q13. What is a CDN and how does it improve performance?
A:  Content Delivery Network caches content on edge servers worldwide to reduce latency
    and speed up content delivery.

Q14. Explain the role of IP, MAC, and Port in networking.
A.   IP: It helps to Identify the host across networks.
     MAC: It Identifies device within a LAN.
     Port: Identifies specific application/service.

Q15. What is latency and what are the causes? 
A:   Latency is the total time delay between when a data packet is sent from a source and when it is received at the destination.
     In simple terms, it measures how long it takes for information to travel across a network.

     Causes of latency include:
     -Propagation delay – Time taken for signals to travel through the medium (fiber, copper, wireless).
     -Transmission delay – Time taken to push all packet bits onto the link.
     -Processing delay – Time routers or switches take to examine and forward packets.
     -Queuing delay – Time packets wait in queues during congestion.

Q16. Explain the TCP 3-Way Handshake.
A:   To establish a reliable connection between client and server.
     Steps:
     -SYN: Client sends SYN (synchronize) to initiate connection.
     -SYN-ACK: Server responds with SYN-ACK (synchronize + acknowledge).
     -ACK: Client sends final ACK confirming connection.
     Result:
     Both sides agree to start communication then data transfer begins.

Q17. How does HTTPS ensure security?
A:  -It Uses TLS handshake to exchange encryption keys.
    -The Data is encrypted using symmetric cryptography.
    - The Server identity is verified via digital certificate.

Q18. What is MTU and what happens when a packet exceeds MTU?
A:   MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) is the largest packet size that can be transmitted.
     If exceeded it will perform fragmentation or packet drop.

Q19. Explain Network Function Virtualization (NFV).
A:  -NFV replaces hardware-based network functions (firewalls, load balancers) with virtualized software.
    -It Runs on commodity servers → reduces cost and increases scalability.
    -Often works alongside SDN for dynamic service deployment.

Q20. What is QUIC protocol and how is it better than TCP?
A:   -QUIC (by Google) runs on UDP but adds encryption, reliability, and multiplexing.
     -It Reduces latency by combining TLS + transport handshake.
     -It Prevents head-of-line blocking seen in TCP
