# Beginner Python Programs

This folder contains a few beginner-friendly Python programs with clear
comments and simple command-line prompts so new contributors can learn and run them.

Programs included:

- `factorial.py` — Compute factorial of a non-negative integer.
- `palindrome.py` — Check whether a given string or number is a palindrome.
- `fibonacci.py` — Generate the first N Fibonacci numbers.

How to run

Open a terminal and run one of the scripts with your Python 3 interpreter. Examples:

```bash
python3 python/beginner/factorial.py
python3 python/beginner/palindrome.py
python3 python/beginner/fibonacci.py
```

Each script will prompt you for input and print the result. They are intentionally
simple and well-commented so beginners can read and understand how they work.

Next steps (suggested contributions)

- Add unit tests for each script.
- Add an explanation.md with step-by-step breakdowns for each algorithm.
- Add more beginner-friendly programs (e.g., prime check, simple sorting demos).
