### Python Algorithms Index

This folder contains clean, interview-focused Python implementations with tiny self-tests.

Run any file directly to execute its quick tests, for example:

```bash
python Python/two_sum.py
python Python/binary_search_iterative.py
python Python/sliding_window_max.py
python Python/lru_cache.py
```

Included so far:
- `two_sum.py`: Single-pass hashmap, returns indices.
- `binary_search_iterative.py`: Iterative binary search over sorted array.
- `sliding_window_max.py`: Deque-based O(n) sliding window maximum.
- `lru_cache.py`: LRU using OrderedDict and manual linked list variant.
- `LRU_Cache_Explained.md`: Concise explanation and usage notes.

Contributions welcome: add new problem files with a tiny `_run_tests()` and update this index.
